        I have tried subsurface scattering and scattering in this project. For subsurface scattering, I tested my implementation with skin, marble and juice. For scattering,
        I attempted to render scenes with participating medium and achieved foggy effects. Basically my current implementation can handle sky rendering too, but I have not tried that.
        I think cloud rendering is more about volumetric effects so I may try that in the <a href="../pr10/index.html">the other project</a>.
