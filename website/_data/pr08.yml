  des: Cornell box with stained glass lighting. I put almost everything together in this image, like DOF, color bleeding, caustics by both specular object and transparent object, specular and glossy reflection. Aslo, this image is a tonemapped version. The original is stored as an <a href='./images/cornellbox.hdr'>HDR image</a>, and you can also see a linear-mapped LDR version <a href='./images/cornell18432.png'>here</a>.
